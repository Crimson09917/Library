Doing this shit later

1 - User defines origin point
2 - User defines x1, y1
3 - User defines x2, y2
4 - The computer runs through the entire bounds
5 - Records all the alive pixels relative to the origin
6 - This new array is appended to the presets.js file (not actually like permanently tho probably)
7 - Reference it as normal
8 - Please end this suffering please dear lord.
